## Registration

Registration procedure depends on the student profile:

* **Master students at ETSETB:** 
Follow the regular schedule from your academic office. 

* __Bachelor (grau) students at ETSETB and CFIS students__: 
Do not register to this course but to ["Introduction to Deep Learning"](https://telecombcn-dl.github.io/2019-idl/), a lighter version of this course offered as a intensive Winter School between 22-28 January 2020. Check with your academic office.

* __MSc Students at UPC but not in ETSETB__: Contact the your academic office and request being allowed to take this course. If accepted, contact [ETSETB academic office](http://www.etsetb.upc.edu/ca/els-serveis/secretaria-oberta) and request more details.

* __Other students currently enroled in another academic program outside UPC__: You can request attending to the seminar by sending your CV and motivation letter to the [ETSETB academic office](http://www.etsetb.upc.edu/ca/els-serveis/secretaria-oberta), clearly showing your previous knowledge in deep learning and their software frameworks. If accepted, you will need to cover the full cost of the course (around 720 euros, which correspond to 5 ECTS). You must already be legally eligible to attend to this course, we will not release any acceptance later for visas.

* __Other profiles (eg. industry members)__: This course is not addressed to this audience. If you are interested in this topic, we suggest you consider the postgraduate program in [Artificial Intelligence with Deep Learning][aidl-upcschool] from UPC School. This postgraduate extends the dep learning contents offered at UPC TelecomBCN. Next edition starts in November 2019.
